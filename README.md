# File_Zipper
The project aims to create an "Enhanced File Zipper" using Python's Tkinter for GUI, with Zipfile and Pyzipper for compression and AES encryption. It allows users to select multiple files, choose compression levels, and set password protection. The app also tracks recent files, shows compression stats, and supports unzipping to a chosen directory.
